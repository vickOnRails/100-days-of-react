# 100 Days of React

This is a log of my #100daysofreact.

In the next 3 months, I'll be working on a large, React based project. I feel like this is my opportunity to learn React beyond the surface by writing React everyday for the next 100days. 

## Rules
I really don't want to set rulesðŸ˜….

But documenting the journey in a helpful way will require me to define rules that help me put actionable learnings front and center of the project. 

Each day will be organised into

**What I worked on**
**What Challenges I faced**
**What I learned**

This kind of structure will help me focus on my learnings. 

So let's get started... 

Day 1

Day 3
