# 100 Days of React

This is a log of my 100daysofreact.

I'll be working on a large React based application for the next 3 months. While I kinda get React, I feel like this is my opportunity to go really deep and understand it beyond the surface.

## Rules
I really don't want to set rulesðŸ˜….

But documenting my learnings in a helpful requires I define rules upfront. Rules that'll help me put actionable learnings front and center of the experiment. 

Each day will be organised into

-**What I worked on**
-**What Challenges I faced**
-**What I learned**

So let's get started...
